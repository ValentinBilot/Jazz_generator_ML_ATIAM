## Brief architecture and input/output abstract

### Generator :

    The Generator takes a sequence from the database of size sequence_length_in, this sequence goes to a RNN (rnn, lstm or gru), 
    then, the last hidden_state of the rnn goes to a fully connected (linear) layer that generates one chord. This chord is added 
    to the sequence, while the first chord of the sequence is removed. We then repeat this process until we generate a new sequence
    of length sequence_length_out.
    
### Discriminator :

    The Discriminator takes a sequence of chords ad its input, this sequence goes to a RNN, and ad before, the last layer of the 
    hidden_state of the RNN is used as an input for a linear layer. This linear layer then outputs a scalar. The goal of the 
    discriminator is to output 1 if the input data was from the dataset and 0 if it was generated by the generator.
