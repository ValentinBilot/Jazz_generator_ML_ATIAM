# Jazz_generator_ML_ATIAM
Machine Learning Project to generate jazz like a boss

If you see this project for the first time, start by having a look in the SimpleRNNs folder. 

The goal is to generate sequences of chords from one given sequence, it can be used to generate original music, and in the future may be used to follow a musician in an improvisation session.
